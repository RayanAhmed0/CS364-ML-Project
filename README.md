# CS364 Machine Learning Course Project 


> Nowadays, many people face the risk of heart attacks, and it's challenging to predict if someone will have one soon. To get an idea, you'd need to consult a specialist who can analyze vital data.
> However, the predictions from this analysis may not be very accurate. The specialist can provide instructions to help prevent a heart attack but cannot definitively predict the likelihood.
> In our project, we're using the UCI (University of California, Irvine) heart attack dataset. We aim to predict the chances of a heart attack using fourteen features from around 300 instances/rows.
